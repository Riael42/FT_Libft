# 42's Libft

Libft, at the title suggests, is a library of ft functions. 
Replicating these functions has given me understanding of 
the language and working with it, and also increased my 
appreciations of good functions as well as helped me understand
that even if my work makes no sense (as in the case of lcpy and lcat)
it can still be done well.
